      <div class="faq">
		
		<p><i>Why</i>: Adverb, conjunction.</p>
		
		<h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
		<p>Every other Miiverse clone sucked (look at the FAQ), and if they didn't, then they were made with spaghetti. Discord guilds won't cut it either, and anyone could make those, they're unoriginal and suck. Also, I need money.</p>
		<h2>Why should I join?</h2>
		<p>Well, we have..</p>
		<ul>
		<li>No post limit, duh</li>
		<li>No over-protective rules made to conform to 7 year olds, duh</li>
		<li>The ability to do what you want, duh</li>
		<li>Friend requests and messaging! Activity Feed posting!</li>
		<li>Post editing! You can draw on PC!!!!!!!!!!</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ariankordi/closedverse">Open-source!</a> Make yourself a pizza pasta.</li>
		<li>Miiverse users. You know, the ones you know and love.</li>
		<li>This works after Miiverse shuts down. That is, if Nintendo doesn't shut down their Miis server. Please do not do that Nintendo thanks bye also don't sue me.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?</h2>
		<p>Okay, so</p>
		<ul>
		<li>At the moment (as of writing this, November 4th 2017, hey there!), there isn't a block/report function &#58387;</li>
		<li>But that doesn't mean that we don't have ANY admins though.</li>
		<li>Sometimes, it's slow. Other times, it's fast. It varies.</li>
		<li>The owner has school.</li>
		<li>Is this even legal?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However...</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Since we have so many Miiverse users here, and we have completely free sharing of online accounts, you can search for one of your favorite users and hopefully they have something on their profile!!!!!!</li>
		<li>If you make your nickname &lt;= 2 characters long and your username short and never Yeah or comment or post anything and tell your friends to do the same, you can have a completely private account!!!</li>
		<li>This is developing. Even though nobody has made a pull request, anyone could commit to this if they really wanted to. ANYONE.</li>
		<li>Even if this fails, you know the code is public. Who knows what someone might do with it? What will YOU do with it? Don't give me the "I don't know progamming!!!!!" answer, you can learn Python 3 easily. Trust me, I know.</li>
		<li>I'm committed. Don't think I'll not do anything about a problem, I'm always here. (unless I'm on vacation or something)</li>
		</ul>
        
		<h2>Who even are you?</h2>
		<p>Probably the owner. I don't know, this is <a href="https://github.com/ariankordi/closedverse/blob/master/closedverse_main/templates/closedverse_main/help/why.html">hardcoded into the thing</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>Why are you so happy?</h2>
		<p>I'm feeling like it today.</p>
		
		<h2>Can I translate this into my language?</h2>
		<p>No. <s>(t yet)</s></p>
